# Team Profile Images

## Instructions for adding real profile images:

1. **Delowar Hossain's Image**:

   - Save the image of the man with the child (at Farmers Insurance) as:
   - `/public/assets/imgs/team/delowar-hossain.jpg`
   - Recommended size: 300x300px

2. **Kamrun Bithi's Image**:
   - Save the image of the woman with the flower as:
   - `/public/assets/imgs/team/kamrun-bithi.jpg`
   - Recommended size: 300x300px

## Image Requirements:

- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Size: 300x300px (square aspect ratio works best)
- File names should match exactly as specified above

## Current Status:

- ContactCard component is ready to display images
- Image paths are configured in Section1.tsx
- CSS is optimized for profile photo display with hover effects

The images should be cropped to show the person's face clearly, as the CSS will apply circular cropping and scaling effects on hover.
